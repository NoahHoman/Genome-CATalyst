# Genome-CATalyst

Experimental genome algorithm to solve the DCJ-Median problem using real world genomic data gathered from GenBank. The algorithm was designed to work with big cat datasets but any tsv file
from GenBank should be compatible. Made as part of a graduate course on computational methods for molecular biology at North Carolina State University.
